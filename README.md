# OpenFASoC - Fully Open-Source Autonomous SoC Synthesis using Customizable Cell-Based Synthesizable Analog Circuits

OpenFASoC is a project focused on automated analog generation from user specification to GDSII with fully open-sourced tools. It is led by a team of researchers at the University of Michigan and is inspired from FASoC which sits on proprietary software.

# MY TASK: Generating AUX CELLS for OpenFASoC Flow
Aux Cells are part of big analog design which cannot be implemented with exisiting standerd cell in library. For different designs we have different aux cells. We have to manually create these.

- We are using ALIGN TOOL for this. More at:
